# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart =
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### General Description of Dataset

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
representing a product from an instacart order. Total 15 Variables
include identifier for order, product, user and aisle. The dataset
includes name-specific variables like the name of the
department(e.g. daily eggs, produce), aisle(e.g. yogurt, fresh
vegetables) and product(e.g. Bulgarian Yogurt, Asparagus). Besides,
there are some order-level variables, describing the order sequence
number for one user, the day of the week on which the order was placed
and the hour of the day on which the order was placed.The dataset also
contains a variable (named “reordered”) describing that whether the
product has been ordered by this user in the past.

In total, there are 39123 kind of products from 131209 orders by 131209
users.

#### Below is a 134 x 2 tibble showing the number of items ordered from aisle and sorting in descending order

There are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables ranking No.1 of the items
ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

#### Below is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle(items whose number is \<=10000 are excluded)

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n>10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle=fct_reorder(aisle,n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + geom_point() +labs(x = "Aisle",y= "Number",title = "Number of items ardered in each aisle") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1.2))
```

#### Below is a table showing the three most poplular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c( "baking ingredients","dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  select(aisle,everything()) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter( rank<4 ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |

| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

#### A table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name,order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  spread(key=order_dow, value= mean_hour) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2

#### Data cleaning

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss =
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  as_tibble(brfss_smart2010) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic %in% c("Overall Health")) %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Poor","Very good", "Good","Fair")) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

#### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

According to filtered data below,in 2002, there are 6 states observed at
7 or more locations, which are CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA. In 2010, there
are 14 states observed at 7 or more locations, which are CA, CO, FL, MA,
MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH.

``` r
location_2002 =
  brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr,locationdesc) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs =n()) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs =n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs >=7)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
location_2010 =
  brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr,locationdesc) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs =n()) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs =n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs >=7)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

#### Construct a dataset

``` r
Excellent_dataset =
  brfss %>% 
  filter(response== "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr,locationdesc) %>% 
  mutate(mean=mean(data_value)) %>% 
  select(response,year,locationabbr,locationdesc,mean) 
```

# Problem 3

#### Load,tidy,and otherwise wrangle the data

This dataset concerning accelerometer data collected on a 63 year-old
male with BMI 25 has 50400 rows and 5 columns
